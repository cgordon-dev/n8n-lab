## ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Optimization

### üéØ **Priority 1: Intent Extraction Enhancement**

**Issue**: 64.7% pass rate with specific weaknesses in simple/moderate categories

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Webhook Detection Gap**: System frequently misses "Webhook" as explicit integration
2. **Trigger Type Confusion**: Tendency to default to "manual" rather than "webhook" 
3. **Simple Request Over-complexity**: Paradoxically worse on basic scenarios

**Specific Failures**:
- "Create a webhook that posts to Slack" ‚Üí Missed "Webhook" integration
- "Email notifications for form submissions" ‚Üí Wrong trigger type classification
- Simple requests ‚Üí 33.3% pass rate vs 66.7% for complex requests

**Recommended Solutions**:
```yaml
prompt_enhancements:
  webhook_detection:
    rule: "When user mentions 'webhook', always include 'Webhook' in integrations"
    examples: ["webhook endpoint", "incoming webhook", "webhook trigger"]
  
  trigger_classification:
    webhook_definition: "External system calls your workflow URL"
    manual_definition: "User manually starts the workflow"
    schedule_definition: "Time-based automatic activation"
    triggered_definition: "Another workflow or service activates this one"
  
  integration_extraction:
    prefer_generic: "Use 'Email' not 'Gmail', 'Form' not 'Contact Form'"
    explicit_services: "Always include mentioned service names as integrations"
```

### üéØ **Priority 2: Confidence Calibration**

**Issue**: Template matching scores (0.2-0.3) fall below system threshold (0.5)

**Impact**: Prevents workflow creation despite finding relevant templates

**Solution**: Lower confidence threshold to 0.3 or implement adaptive scoring

### üéØ **Priority 3: Simple Request Optimization** 

**Issue**: Counter-intuitive poor performance on basic workflows (33.3% vs 66.7% complex)

**Hypothesis**: System over-analyzes simple requests, missing obvious patterns

**Solution**: Implement request complexity detection with simplified processing paths
