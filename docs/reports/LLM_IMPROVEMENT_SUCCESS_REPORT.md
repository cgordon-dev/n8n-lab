## 🚀 Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced System Prompt Structure
```
You are an expert n8n workflow automation assistant specializing in intent extraction.

INTEGRATION DETECTION RULES (CRITICAL - ALWAYS FOLLOW):
- If user mentions "webhook" → ALWAYS include "Webhook" in integrations
- If user mentions "form" or "submission" → ALWAYS include "Form" in integrations
- Use GENERIC service names: "Email" not "Gmail"
- Common n8n integrations: Slack, Discord, Email, Webhook, Form, Schedule...

TRIGGER TYPE DECISION RULES (Choose ONE):
- webhook: External system calls your workflow (webhooks, forms, API calls)
- schedule: Time-based activation (daily, weekly, cron)
- manual: User manually starts ("I want to run", "let me trigger")

EXAMPLES FOR REFERENCE:
✓ "Create webhook for Slack" → integrations: ["Webhook", "Slack"], trigger: "webhook"
✓ "Email notifications for forms" → integrations: ["Email", "Form"], trigger: "webhook"

CRITICAL: For simple requests, be extra thorough in detecting ALL integrations.
```

### Validation Rules Architecture
```python
class IntentValidator:
    def validate_and_correct_intent(self, intent, user_request):
        # 1. Webhook detection validation
        # 2. Form detection validation  
        # 3. Schedule detection validation
        # 4. Integration normalization
        # 5. Trigger type validation and correction
        # 6. Remove duplicates
        return corrected_intent, corrections
```

### Multi-Pass Extraction Pipeline
```python
async def extract_intent_with_validation(self, user_message):
    # Pass 1: Main extraction using improved prompt
    intent = await self.extract_intent(user_message)
    
    # Pass 2: Validation and correction
    validated_intent, corrections = self.validator.validate_and_correct_intent(intent, user_message)
    
    # Pass 3: Confidence scoring
    confidence_score = self.validator.calculate_confidence_score(validated_intent, user_message)
    
    return validated_intent, confidence_score, corrections
```
